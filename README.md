# Encryption-by-Polynomial-Root-Finding-Method-and-Zaslavsky-Equations

 MATLAB functions ENCR.m and DECR.m perform the text encryption/decription technique by using polynomial root finding method
 and decimated output of Zaslavsky equation.
 
 The scripts are based on the technique presented in the submited paper:
 "Secure Text Encryption Using Polynomial Root Finding Method and Decimated Output of Zaslavsky Equations"

 The text example "Shumen University" is used to illustrate the encryption/decription process.
