# Encryption-by-Polynomial-Root-Finding-Method-and-Zaslavsky-Equations

 MATLAB functions ENCR.m and DECR.m perform the text encryption/decription technique by using polynomial root finding method
 and decimated output of Zaslavsky equation.
 
 This script is based on the technique presented in the submited paper:
 "Secure Text Encryption Using Polynomial Root Finding Method and Decimated Output of Zaslavsky Equations"
